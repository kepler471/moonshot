# Room Naming Convention 

**All room names should use the format:**

`room_[U-D-L-R]_XXXX.tscn`

- `room` : all rooms must start with this prefix.
- `[U-D-L-R]` :  ( Up - Down - Left - Right )  Thsse are the exits present in the room, delete as necessary.
- `XXXX` : The name of the room, go nuts, be unique; memorable names are better than numbers and we don't then have to worry about name clashes.
